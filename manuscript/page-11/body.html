But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!</p><p>The Kid knew there was little hope for him.</p><p>"Please, Mr. Wolf," he said trembling, "I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can."</p><p>The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.</p><p>Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.</p><p><em>Do not let anything turn you from your purpose .</em></p></div> </div>
