"What if you should fall! Please listen to me and come down! Here you can get all you want of the finest, tenderest grass in the country."</p><p>The Goat looked over the edge of the cliff.</p><p>"How very, very anxious you are about me," she said, "and how generous you are with your grass! But I know you! It's your <em>own</em> appetite you are thinking of, not mine!"</p><p><em>An invitation prompted by selfishness is not to be accepted.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
