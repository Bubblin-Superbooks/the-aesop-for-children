He visited the hen house very often and at last got so greedy that he would swallow the eggs whole.</p><p>One day the Dog wandered down to the seashore. There he spied an Oyster. In a twinkling the Oyster was resting in the Dog's stomach, shell and all.</p><p>It pained the Dog a good deal, as you can guess.</p><p>"I've learned that all round things are not eggs," he said groaning.</p><p><em>Act in haste and repent at leisureâ€”and often in pain.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
