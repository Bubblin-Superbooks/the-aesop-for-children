As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud. The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.</p><p>"A <em>great big</em> monster," said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!"</p><p>"Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?"</p><p>"Oh, <em>much</em> bigger!" they cried.</p><p>The Frog puffed up still more.</p><p>"He could not have been bigger than this," she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was <em>much, much</em> bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.</p><p><em>Do not attempt the impossible.</em></p></div> </div>
