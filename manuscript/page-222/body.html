This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen. What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.</p><p>"No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast."</p><p>Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning, beautiful creature!"</p><p>The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"What a charming creature she is!" said the Fox.</p></div> </div>
