They soon began to quarrel, for each of them boasted that he and his kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind.</p><p>Now they reached a clearing in the forest and there stood a statue. It was a representation of Heracles in the act of tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion.</p><p>"See," said the man, "that's how strong <em>we</em> are! The King of Beasts is like wax in our hands!"</p><p>"Ho!" laughed the Lion, "a Man made that statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made it!"</p></div> </div>
