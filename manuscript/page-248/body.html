The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:</p><p>"Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal."</p><p>But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.</p><p>"How foolish I should be," he said, "to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all."</p><p><em>A small gain is worth more than a large promise.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
