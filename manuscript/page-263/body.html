His limbs could no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful indeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die.</p><p>Where now his strength and his former graceful beauty?</p><p>Now a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his yellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even a contemptible Ass let fly his heels and brayed his insults in the face of the Lion.</p><p><em>It is cowardly to attack the defenseless, though he be an enemy.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
