The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p><p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p><p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p><p>"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."</p><p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>There are many who pretend to despise and belittle</em></p></div> </div>
