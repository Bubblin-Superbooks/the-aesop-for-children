He could get it neither up nor down, and of course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state of affairs for a greedy Wolf.</p><p>So away he hurried to the Crane. He was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out.</p><p>"I will reward you very handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me."</p><p>The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the Wolf asked her to do.</p><p>When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he started to walk away.</p></div> </div>
