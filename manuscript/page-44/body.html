As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.</p><p>"How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."</p><p>"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"</p><p><em>Our best blessings are often the least appreciated.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
