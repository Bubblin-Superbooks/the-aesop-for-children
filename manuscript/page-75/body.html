His dancing was very clever indeed, and the animals were all highly pleased with his grace and lightness.</p><p>The praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel envious.

Besides, the animals found it hard to keep their toes from under his heavy hoofs.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">At last, when one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose, the animals were so disgusted that they set upon the Camel in a rage and drove him</p></div> </div>
