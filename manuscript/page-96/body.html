That leap was so great, he said, that no other man could leap anywhere near the distance. A great many persons in Rhodes had seen him do it and would prove that what he told was true.</p><p>"No need of witnesses," said one of the hearers. "Suppose this city is Rhodes. Now show us how far you can jump."</p></div> </div>
